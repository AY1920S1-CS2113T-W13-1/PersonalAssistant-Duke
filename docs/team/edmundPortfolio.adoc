The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my contributions to the Coach Manager project for the Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming module CS2113T, as well as to display my ability to code in Java and apply OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts.

== PROJECT: Coach Manager

== Overview

My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line based personal assistant for our project in our Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Programming module, CS2113T. We chose to morph it into a graphical user interface (GUI), but the Coach Manager can still be operated via the command line. This enhanced application enables coaches to use the coach manager easily to keep track of the classes and students which the coach is in charge of. The schedule and lessons to be taught can be viewed by the coach, and training plans can even be adjusted as per requirements. In addition, the coach manager helps the trainer track the progress of the students by making comparisons between their current standards to past records or personal best. There are also goals of the day as well as the lessons learnt for the day for the coach to keep track of personal progress in coaching.

Shown below is what our project interface looks like.

== My Role

My role was to handle the functionalities of the sub-schedule section of the coach manager such as the special goals of the day, as well as the lessons learnt for the day to allow coaches to reflect on any improvements seen in students, or if any students require assistance for the near future. These features can be stored, viewed, and edited. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and community contributions to the team project. For coding contributions, I contributed to the goals of the day as well as the lessons learnt for the day. For documentation, I made cosmetic improvements to the existing User Guide and Developer Guide to make it more reader-friendly. For community, I fix Checkstyle and Travis violations.

* *Major Enhancement added*: I added the ability to view goals/lessons of the day, add a goal/lesson to a specified day, and delete goal(s)/lesson(s) from a specified day.
** What it does: After entering the goals/lessons of the day from the daily schedule, the coach manager will prompt the coach to enter the date of the day they are interested in. After that, all possible actions will be shown along with their input number.
- 1 will show all the goals/lessons of the day 
- 2 will add a goal/lesson to the day
- 3 will delete a goal/lesson from the day 
- 4 will remove all goals/lessons from the day 
- 5 will be to quit the goals/lessons of the day and bring the user back to daily schedule. 
- If 2 or 3 is chosen, the coach manager will prompt the coach for an additional input, the input should be the description of the goal/lesson which the coach wants to add to or delete from the day.
** Justification: The importance of the goals of the day is to allow coaches to focus on what they want to achieve through their trainings for the rest of the day. The importance of the lessons learnt of the day is to allow coaches to record down and reflect on what they have observed through their training by the end of the day.
* *Code contributed*: https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/dashboard/#search=W13-1&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-21&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=NotTheRealEdmund&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D

* *Other contributions*:

** Project contributions:There were a total of 5 releases, from version 1.0 to 1.4. I contributed to releases versions 1.0 to 1.5 (5 releases) on GitHub.
** Documentation:
*** Made cosmetic improvements to the existing User Guide and Developer Guide to make it more reader-friendly.
** Community:
*** Fix Checkstyle and Travis violations.
