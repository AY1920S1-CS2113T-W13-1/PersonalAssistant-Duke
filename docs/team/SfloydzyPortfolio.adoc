== PROJECT: Sports Manager

---

== Overview

Coach Manager is a [function, Eg:a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.]

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: supplied main code from Duke levels 1-9 as code source
** Main code source to operate Duke

** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Major enhancement*: Created the JavaFX UI with FXML files.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases 1.0 - 1.3 on GitHub
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Eg: Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Eg: Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
** Documentation:
*** Eg: Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]

**Contributions to Developer Guide
== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Scheduler
This mechanism is largely supported by the `Storage`, `TaskList` and `TimeSlot` and facilitated by  `Parser` Classes.

The class diagram above illustrates the Schedule Class.

In schedule class there are methods to get:

* The current month
* The current timetable for the day
* Viewing the timetable for a given day
* Adding more Classes to the day
* Deleting specific classes
* Deleting all classes in a specific day

In this feature there are a few main commands.

The flow of these commands and how they are executed will be described below. A sequence diagram will be given to help illustrate the process.

1. <<addDay>>

==== addDay
The TimeSlot Class implements the login feature by creating an object that represents a scheduled class in a day.

|===
|Step 1. The user keys in the command `schedule add STARTDATETIME ENDDATETIME VENUE CLASSNAME`.
|Step 2. `Parser` recognises this command and parse the arguments.
|Step 3. `Parser` will send the parsed arguments to `Schedule`. It will call the command `addClass`.
|Step 4. `Schedule` will call `TaskList` method `dateConvert` to convert the string arguments of the start date-time and end date-time into a date object.
|Step 5. `Schedule will now call create a new `TimeSlot` object to contain all the data of the newly added class.
|Step 6. The new `TimeSlot` object will be passed into an ArrayList containing all `TimeSlot` objects.
|Step 7. The updated ArrayList will be saved via a text file when `Storage` calls function `saveScheduler`.
|Step 8. `addClass` will return to `Parser` saying it is successful.
|===

The following sequence diagram below shows the flow of `addDay`.

** Community:
*** Eg: PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Eg: Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Eg: Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Eg: Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Eg: Integrated a third party library (Travis) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
*** Eg: Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
