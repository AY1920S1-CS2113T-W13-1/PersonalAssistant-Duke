== PROJECT: Coach Manager

== Overview

This portfolio serves to document my contributions in a team-based software engineering project for the module CS2113T. The team comprises of 4 members ad we were tasked to develop a working application within 8 weeks. Throughout the project, we were challenged to incorporate a Software Engineering project into a product of our own. We decided to morph the existing application into a task manager, called Coach Manager.

To comply with the module requirements, the team is constrained to start from an existing code base – Duke Level 9 and the user must interact with the application via Command Line interface(CLI).

Coach Manager is a desktop application created for trainers to assist them in managing their schedule and the progress of their students.

This is what our project looks like.

My role was to manage the overall project and manage the Git Repo. I also ensured code quality across pull requests. I designed and wrote the code for the `Schedule Manager`, `GUI` and `Storage` features. I have added to the user guide and developer guides in relation to these features as well.

== Summary of contributions

* *Feature*: Supplied code source of the project
** Provided the code outline for the OOP interaction between classes

* *Feature*: Schedule Manager
*** What it does: Manages all the schedule classes and represents them in a daily/weekly/monthly view that is easy to see

* *Feature*: GUI
*** What it does: Provides a graphic user interface that is easy to see and navigate.
*** Justification: Clearly represents the system for the user. Navigation and accessibility of functions are graphically represented. No mistakes from the user side will be made when keying in commands.
*** Highlights: This feature works to be implemented in the future v2.0 update.

== Contributions to Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._

=== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Scheduler
This mechanism is largely supported by the `Storage`, `TaskList` and `TimeSlot` and facilitated by  `Parser` Classes.

image::scheduleClassDiagram.png[align="left"]

The class diagram above illustrates the Schedule Class.

In schedule class there are methods to get:

* The current month
* The current timetable for the day
* Viewing the timetable for a given day
* Adding more Classes to the day
* Deleting specific classes
* Deleting all classes in a specific day

In this feature there are a few main commands.

The flow of these commands and how they are executed will be described below. A sequence diagram will be given to help illustrate the process.



==== addDay
The TimeSlot Class implements the login feature by creating an object that represents a scheduled class in a day.

|===
|Step 1. The user keys in the command `schedule add STARTDATETIME ENDDATETIME VENUE CLASSNAME`.
|Step 2. `Parser` recognises this command and parse the arguments.
|Step 3. `Parser` will send the parsed arguments to `Schedule`. It will call the command `addClass`.
|Step 4. `Schedule` will call `TaskList` method `dateConvert` to convert the string arguments of the start date-time and end date-time into a date object.
|Step 5. `Schedule will now call create a new `TimeSlot` object to contain all the data of the newly added class.
|Step 6. The new `TimeSlot` object will be passed into an ArrayList containing all `TimeSlot` objects.
|Step 7. The updated ArrayList will be saved via a text file when `Storage` calls function `saveScheduler`.
|Step 8. `addClass` will return to `Parser` saying it is successful.
|===

The following sequence diagram below shows the flow of `addDay`.

=== Features

==== Menu
*Description:* The trainer is able to navigate across the different features of the app easily. He may also see the list of commands for each featured menu.

*Format: `_[MENU NUMBER]_`*

* Navigates from the list of menu options to the listed menu option.

Example:



* Entering “1” will direct user to “Training Schedule Menu”



=== Training Schedule
**Description: ** Feature allows the trainer to add or remove training days to a training schedule. The manager may select to view the schedule by the day/week/month. After creating a training day, they will be able to add students to the class.

*Must be inside the Training Schedule Menu*

*View schedule for days*

Able to see all the days given in the month.

** *Option:* `1`

*** See which day is the present day
*** highlights which days have classes


*View all days in the week*

Able to see all the days given in the present week.

* *Option:* `2`

**  See which day in the week has classes

*View next/previous week/month*

Able to see all the days upcoming or prior week/month.

* *Option:* `3`
*** Shows a calendar of the present month
