This portfolio serves to document my contributions to the team-based software engineering project for the module CS2113T and also to display my ability to code in Java and in object-orientated concept

== PROJECT: Coach Manager

== Overview

My team of 4 computer engineering students and I were tasked with creating a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application for our software engineering project. Our team decided on creating an application called Coach Manager that functions as a planner to manage
information that a trainer or coach would need to handle, and will be used by them. This planner can serve as a timetable for users
to check their schedule for any specified day, save information of students into the system, or to manage pre-specified plans that would
simplify the demands of users all in a single platform tailored to the specific needs of sports managers or coaches.


For our application, we have 3 main features. The schedule feature, student feature and the training circuit feature. The schedule
feature comprises of mainly the calendar function, and can be used to integrate information from the other 2 features. The student
feature manages student information, while the training circuit feature manages the training plans for a user to use.

Shown below is what our project interface looks like.

== Summary of contributions
My main role was to design and write codes for the training circuit features. That is to create the basis for coaches to save their
training plans into, or to pull it up and edit it anytime they need.

* *Major Enhancements*: I added the ability to create new training plans, view existing training plans (if any), or to
edit the current training plans. To simplify the commands for this document, each sub-feature can be called and executed
under these commands, `new`, `view` and `edit` respectively.
** What it does: The `new` command allows the user to create a new training plan to be saved into the application, the
`view` command allows the user to look at existing plans and the `edit` command allows the user to edit existing plans to their
preferences.
** Justification:  The importance of the training circuit feature is to allow users to create existing templates of multiple
activities that users will use to train their students with.
*** The `new` command is used to create a new training circuit that will be used by the users on a regular basis.
*** The `view` command is used in the event that users forgot about a certain activity to do, or to review current training circuits.
*** The `edit` command is to allow users to change activities in training circuits that are outdated, or to create a better circuit.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/dashboard/#search=w13-1&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-21&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=eujingsen&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Functional code]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Documentation:
*** Eg: I made cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide in terms of line or space formatting between header, sub-header and other information to
standardize our formatting.
** Community:
*** Eg : I helped to clear Checkstyle violations that our team faced in our code


== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_ The sections given below is what I contributed to the User Guide based on the enhancements I made. There are many commands that I have created, but I will list out the main features below_
|===

* *Creating a new training plan*: `new`
** This command will allow users to create new training plans to be saved into the application.

** Example:
Let’s say that you are a new user of the Coach Manager with no training circuits saved into the application. After familiarizing
yourselves with the commands that can be executed by the application, you start off with creating some training circuits.
.	To start, you type in the `new` command in the command line. The application will then prompt you to input a certain intensity
level for the training circuit that you are going to create to better separate training circuits into their respective intensity level.
You can choose between the levels high, moderate or relaxed.
.	Let’s say you choose the high intensity level. Right after, the application will prompt the user to add a new activity to the
circuit, finalize the circuit activities, or to show your current additions to the list.
.	To add 	an activity, you can input an activity in the format as shown in the picture below. Otherwise, you can type show to show
the current activities already added in order, or type finalize to finalize the creation of the plan.

The class diagram above illustrates the *_MyPlan_* class.

In the *_MyPlan_* class, there are various methods for the training circuit functionalities, some of the main features include:

•	Getting the map of circuits through the Storage class.
•	Retrieving a list of circuits present in the map.
•	Creating a new circuit.
•	Viewing an existing circuit.
