== PROJECT: Coach Manager

---

== Overview

This portfolio serves to document my contributions in a team-based software engineering project for the module CS2113T. The team comprises of 4 members and we were tasked to develop a working application within 8 weeks. Throughout the project, we were challenged to incorporate a Software Engineering project into a product of our own. We decided to morph the existing application into a task manager, called Coach Manager.

To comply with the module requirements, the team is constrained to start from an existing code base – Duke Level 9 and the user must interact with the application via Command Line interface(CLI).

Coach Manager is a desktop application created for trainers to assist them in managing their schedule and the progress of their students.

This is what our project looks like.

My role was to design a feature that Manages student `details` and `progress` which allow trainers to better organise
their students and keep track of their training progress.

== Summary of contributions

* *Feature*: Added Manage Student Feature.
** What it does: It allows the trainer to manage any relevant information that involves the students.
** Justification: This feature allows the trainer to add a new student and their details, add their training progress and additional notes to a particular student and they are also able to search any keywords in the section.
The commands for this feature can be view from the User Guide {Insert User Guid Link}.

* *Feature*: Added a Menu-based feature.
** What it does: This feature allows the trainer to navigate through respective sections of the app easily.
This feature is implemented through the ParserCommand class.

* *Code contributed*:
 ** [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/duke/parser/ParserCommand.java[ParserCommand code]] [https://github.com[Test Code]]
 ** [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-W13-1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/duke/parser/ParserManageStudents.java[ParserManageStudents]] [https://github.com[Test Code]]

*** Eg: Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** I integrated continuous Integration, code reviews and code analytics tools:
**** Continuous Integration tools: Travis-CI


== Contributions to the User Guide


_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

*1. View all students:* `list`  +
Shows a list of all the students in the coach manager.

** *Format*: `list`
** *Examples*:
|===
|Enter command `list` once you are in Manage Students menu. +

|Output: +
Here are your list of students: +
1. Danish +
2. Eddie +
3. Scott +
4. Jing Sen +
5. Edmund
|===
*2. Locating a student by name:* `find`  +
Find a student whose names contain any of the given keywords.

** *Format:* `find [KEYWORDS]`

* Short-form will still be matched.  e.g Dan will match Danish
* The search is case insensitive. e.g danish will match Danish
* Only the name is searched

** *Examples*:
|===
| Enter command `find Dan` once you are in Manage Students menu. +
| Output: +
This will be the output displayed. +
Here are your matching search: +
1. Danish +
2. Danial
|===

*3. Adding a student:* `add` +
Add a new student to the list of students.

** *Format:* `add [STUDENT NAME], [AGE], [ADDRESS]`

** *Example:*

|===

|Enter the command `add Danish, 22, Woodlands` once you are in Manage Student menu. +
| Output: +

|`add Danish, 22, Woodlands` +

Student have been added: +
Name: danish eddie +
Age: 22 +
Address: woodlands +
Now you have 1 students in your list.
|===

*4. Deleting a student:* `delete`  +
Deleting a specific student from the list of students using the index.

** *Format:* `delete [INDEX]`

* Deletes student at the specific INDEX
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list
* Index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3,...

** *Examples:*
|===
| Step 1: Enter command `list` to view your current available student +
 |Step 2: Let's say you want to delete the 3rd student in the list. Send the command `delete 3` +
| Output: +
Deletes the 3rd student on the list
|===

*5. Add progress to a student:* `add progress` *(To be implemented)* +
To add the training progress of a particular student

** *Format*: add progress [INDEX] /n [PROGRESS DETAILS]

** *Example:*
|===
| Step 1: Enter command `add progress 2` to add the progress of the student at the second index of the student list.
| Step 2: Enter the progress pf the student. +
For example: Able to swim breastroke proficiently
| Output: +
 Progress added for Danish

== 2. Setting Up

=== This section provides a step by step walkthrough on how to set up the application.


=== 2.1 Prerequisites


. JDK 11 or above is required

. IntelliJ IDE is recommended.

=== 2.2 Setting up the project on your computer


. Fork and clone the forked remote on your local machine.

. Launch Intellij (If you’re not on the IntelliJ Welcome screen please close your existing project by going to File > Close Project)

. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle

.. Click Configure > Structure for New Projects
.. Under Project Settings Click on Project

.. Under Project SDK Click New… and point it to JDK 11 path.

.. Click OK to save the configuration

. Click Import Project

. Locate the build.gradle file and select it. Click Open.

. Open the IntelliJ console/terminal and run the gradle command gradlew processResource on Windows or ./gradlew processResource on Mac/Linux (If you are encountered a permission error: ./gradlew: Permission denied add the executable permission to the shell script by running chmod 744 gradlew in your terminal) It should finish with the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message. This will generate the resources required by the application and tests.

=== 2.3 Verifying the setup


. Run Duke to verify and try a few commands. (Refer here {insert link to the command page} the commands)

Run the JUNIT Test/gradlew test command to ensure that all the test case passes.


=== 4.1 Manage Students Feature

This feature allows the coaches to handle any relevant details that involves the student such as adding and deleting a student, editing their particulars and adding their progress during training.

==== 4.1.1 Current Implementation

The login mechanism is facilitated by ParserManageStudents, ManageStudents, MyStudent and Storage classes. +
{Add Class diagram}

==== 4.1.2 Add student and view student list command

This feature allows coaches to add students with their main details such as Name, Age and Address in that order. +
addStudentCommand creates a profile for the new student and add them to the student list which will be stored in the JSON file. +
studentList Command views all the available students stored in the JSON file. +
Given below is an example usage scenario of addStudent.
|===
|Step 1. The user keys in the option 2 to direct the ParserCommand into ParserManageStudent.
|Step 2. The user keys in the command add [NAME], [AGE], [ADDRESS].
parserManageStudents recognises this command and parse the arguments.
|Step 3. ParserManageStudents recognises this command and parse the arguments.
|Step 4. ParserManageStudents will send the parsed arguments to ManageStudents. It will call the method addStudent.
|Step 5. addStudent command will call studentList to add the new student into the list
|Step 6. The new student object will be passed into an ArrayList containing all student objects.
|Step 7. The updated ArrayList will be saved via a text file when Storage calls function saveStudentList. User is able to send viewStudents to view an updated list of their students.
|Step 8. addStudent will return to Parser saying it is successful.
